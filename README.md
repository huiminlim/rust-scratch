# Rust Scratchpad

## Setup

To create a new project from scratch, use the following commands.

```cargo
cargo new project-name
cd project-name
cargo run .
```

This command creates a directory with the source code and allows you to compile and execute the binary.

If the directory already exists, use the `init` command instead.

```cargo
cargo init project-name
cd project-name
cargo run .
```
